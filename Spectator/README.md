Product Designer at Spectator Publishing Company in New York, NY.

The Columbia Daily Spectator is Columbia's most popular newspaper. I worked in "Product" within "Business and Industry".

My team worked on enhancing the UI/UX of many of Spectator's products, including:
- The Columbia Daily Spectator website: http://www.columbiaspectator.com/
- The Shaft (a website that helps students navigate Columbia Housing): http://www.theshaft.info/
- Courses@CU (student course scheduling assistant): http://www.coursesatcu.com/
- Spectator Mobile App (iOS)

Since, currently, most users view content on their mobile devices, we decided to create an app to accompany the website.
As a Product Designer, I worked with a team of 2-3 other students to create the interface for Columbia Spectator's new mobile application. We carefully annotated our designs and handed them to developers who implemented our designs.
